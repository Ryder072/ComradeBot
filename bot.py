The identity politics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of liberal arts most of their viewpoints will go over a typical economist's head. There's also a large amount of ethnic genocides, which is deftly woven into communist regimes - Joseph Stalin's forced relocation of millions of Chechens, for instance. The teenagers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the theories, to realize that they're not just starving- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike communism truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the social conditions in Che's existencial catchphrase "The negro is indolent and lazy," which itself is a cryptic reference to Karl Marx's hatred of Jews. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Peter Kropotkin's genius unfolds itself on their iPhone 6.

As an avid Mario Kart player, I can say that I have endured my fair-shares of blue shells. However, after representing Uzbekistan in the 2009 Central Uzbek Nintendo Tournament (CUNT), and receiving at least 69 blue shell attacks, I finally come to the conclusion that the blue shell is not just any ordinary in-game item, but in fact a metaphor for Communism. Think about it. The entire game can be seen as a microcosm for Capitalism. The players that place in the top six gain the most experience, and they receive upbeat and cheerful music after every race, which could represent the privileges 1%. Meanwhile, the players that place below the top six will in fact lose experience, and degrading and sad music will be played after they finish the race. The players below the top six will have to work their way up to the top in order to receive the benefits of the top six. See? A perfect representation of Capitalism! However, there is an item that can be used to disrupt the course of the race; the blue shell. Any player that is not in first can receive this item upon opening up a item box. Said item will track down the player in first, and hit them without failure. Thus giving all the players that are not in first an opportunity to catch up during the race, and therefore equalizing the playing field. Did Nintendo mean to include this? We may never know. I believe that the blue shell is supposed to be a metaphor for Communism, as it can allow those below 6th place (the 1%) to catch up and be equal to those in 6th place and above (the 1%).Thank you all for your time, -An Uzbek Mario Kart Champion"""
